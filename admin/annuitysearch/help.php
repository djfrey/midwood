<h2>How to Search</h2>
<p>Click <strong>Add criteria</strong> to begin.  Once you have entered your criteria, click <strong>Search accounts</strong> to retrieve your results.</p>
<p>If your search returns one or more results, you can export the results to an Excel file by clicking the <strong>Export the results to Excel</strong> link which will be displayed directly above your first result.</p>
<h2>Adding Criteria</h2>
<p>Each criteria added narrows down the search results. For example, searching for Name similar to john will return everyone with the first name John and last name Johnson, as well as anyone else who fits the criteria.  Adding State equals NC will find everyone with Name similar to john who has an address in North Carolina.</p>
<h2>Removing Criteria</h2>
<p>To remove search criteria, click the red "X" to the left of the criteria row.</p>
<h2>More About Search Criteria</h2>
<p>Each criteria added has three inputs: the <strong>field</strong>, the <strong>operator</strong> and the <strong>value</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Field Input</h3>
<p>The field input is the input that determines what in the database we're searching for.  Name, address, and policy number are examples of fields.</p>
<h3>The Value Input</h3>
<p>The value input is the input that determines what will be returned from the database.  For example, you might choose <em>Policy number</em> as the field input and enter <em>123456789</em> as the value you want to find.</p> 
<h3>The Operator Input</h3>
<p>The operator input determines how we search for the field input and the value input.  Most operators are self-explanatory.  Following the example from above, if you wanted to find out information on an account with a policy number of 123456789, you would choose <em>Policy number</em> as the field input, choose <em>equals</em> from the operator input and enter <em>123456789</em> in the value input.</p>
<p>The function of some operators is not immediately obvious.  The <strong>similar to</strong> operator works by finding all values that are similar to what has been entered in the value input.  For example, searching for Name similar to <em>john</em> will return everyone with the first name John and last name Johnson, as well as anyone else who fits the criteria.</p>
<p>The <strong>between</strong> operator finds all values between two inputs.  For example, searching for Account value between <em>1000</em> and <em>10000</em> will find all accounts whose value is between $1000 and $10000.</p>
